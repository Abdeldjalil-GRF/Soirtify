# 🏋️ Sportify – Online Sports Activity Booking Platform

Sportify is a responsive and user-friendly web platform developed as part of the **Web Technologies** course (2024–2025). It allows users to register, log in, and book online sports sessions with professional coaches.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal was to create a complete sports booking platform with core functionalities such as user authentication, activity catalog, booking system, custom quotes, and contact forms — all built using **vanilla web technologies**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL

## ✅ Features Implemented

- **User Authentication**: Registration, login, email uniqueness check, password protection
- **Homepage**: Presentation of the platform, services, and client testimonials
- **Activity Catalog**:
  - Sessions: Yoga, Pilates, Strength Training, Cycling, Fitness, and 1-on-1 Coaching
  - Session details include duration, level, and coach
  - Booking system updates the database and shows a confirmation page
- **Quote Request Page**: Users fill out a form to receive a simulated pricing quote via email
- **Contact Page**: Includes contact info and a working contact form that sends an email to a simulated address (`sportify@mail.com`)

## 🔧 Additional Notes

- Form validation is handled client-side using JavaScript
- The site is fully responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- All functionalities were built without the use of external frameworks (per project requirements)
